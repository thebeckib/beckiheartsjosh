Mockup of vanilla site for @beckibuddin

## Local development
* Clone the repo (either this one or your own fork)
* Set up Compass to build style.css from the scss folder --> `compass watch` using the config.rb file I've included
* Open file `index.html` in your browser  
* Play with things
* Use Developer mode in Chrome a lot
* Push changes back to this repo: `git push origin master`

## Deployment
* Files are hosted on @DeckOfPandas's private server  
* Log in, and go to correct folder  
* Get the changes: `git pull origin master`  
* Admire in self-congratulatory manner

## Things that might be useful to know
* @DeckOfPandas hasn't changed much text, and there are numerous typos etc from the template
* Styling from the template is in scss/theme/ -- don't change these (not all of them are in there yet, but _base.scss is the main one and that's done)
* If you want to change the base template, then overwrite the classes
* Some parameters such as colors have been pulled out of the template, and are in scss/_variables.scss
* @DeckOfPandas's work in progress is in scss/_sandbox.scss, and this could eventually be split out into e.g. _titles.scss, _dividers.scss etc, or possibly even the 'proper' way (i.e. according to the Sass documentaion)
* The RSVP form isn't supposed to work yet
* The Google maps API isn't supposed to work yet
* The instagram and twitter feed in the gallery aren't supposed to work yet

## Helllllp
* Force-refresh a lot 
* Turn Compass off and on again 
* Google
* Ask @DeckOfPandas (totally totally fine)
