                            <br /><br /> He is my rock, my hero and my inspiration. I love his dorky puns and his adorable laugh and I hope to make him laugh every day for the rest of our lives.
                            <br /><br /> Marrying Josh will be the best decision I ever make, and I’m so excited to dance through life like no one’s watching with him.

                                <p style="color:deeppink">
                                    I was 11 when I first joined the kids band at church, just 6 months after
                                    my mum and I had moved to One Church. I didn't have many friends to start with
                                    but joining Purpose gave me the confidence I needed.
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:blue" s>
                                    When I was 14 there was a kids band at church, and seeing as I was at church
                                    every Wednesday anyway (the night of worship practice), I thought it would be a
                                    good idea to join. I want to say it was so I could give back to the church, but
                                    honestly, I just wanted girls to think I was cool; turns out, 14 year old me was
                                    a genius.
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:deeppink">
                                    After a few years, I joined the youth band, and remember being terrified. Josh was
                                    the worship leader on my first night on rota, and he asked me to sing solo! I said
                                    no and avoided him for weeks after.
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:blue">
                                    I first noticed Becki when she joined the youth band, I tried to flirt with her
                                    but I think I just scared her off... From then on, I stuck to just singing and
                                    playing guitar to look good.
                                </p>

                                    I always looked up to Josh and his friends, and found his & Phil's comedy shows at
                                    youth hilarious (I found out later I was the only one). So, as soon as intimidating
                                    Josh moved to America, I pounced and infiltrated the group, finally realising my
                                    full potential as a nerd.

                                    The second time I noticed Becki was when I skyped my friends from America whilst
                                    they were playing Dungeons and Dragons and noticed they had made friends with not one,
                                    but two real, live females (and one of them was really hot). Full of confusion, I
                                    returned home after my year studying abroad, and set about discovering why this girl
                                    had decided to hang out with my nerdy ass friends. Thus began our friendship.

                                    When Josh first returned from America, I was convinced he was going to think I was
                                    lame and kick me out of the friendship group. He even spent the first time we hung out
                                    together making fun of my laugh in front of all our friends <mark style="color:blue">

                                    Becki and I really became good friends after getting to know each other at
                                    a nerd gang road trip to Thorpe Park, and shortly after started going to the cinema
                                    once a week with a few other friends <mark style="color:deeppink">(Unlimited Club for the winnn)</mark> . I always tried to
                                    analyse the films after to seem really smart; I couldn't sing in the cinema, what else
                                    was I supposed to do?

                                    I really started seeing Josh as an attractive guy rather than the funny weirdo with a
                                    good voice when we started the Unlimited Club. When he started wearing smart shirts and
                                    blazers, and kept talking to me everyday, I figured he too saw past my loud, hyperactive side
                                    and was interested in something more than friendship. Unfortunately, I was an idiot.

                                    One day, when I was feeling particularly brave, I asked Becki out to a catch up over coffee,
                                    but due to my awkwardness, I didn't clarify with her what it was. She preceeded to spend the
                                    two hours we spent together talking about all the boys she was in love with, so with a heavy
                                    heart, I took this as a signal that we were just good friends <mark style="color:deeppink">(ouch)</mark>, and did my best to be
                                    there for her.

                                    I was thrilled to get to hang out with Josh one on one, but for some reason I came down
                                    with a bad case of foot in mouth syndrome. I desperately wanted his advice on all of my
                                    “problems”, but to get it I ended up pushing him away. I then focused on staying close friends
                                    with him and we hung out a few more times after that.

                                    After dating for a while and making various terrible decisions, I decided it was time to
                                    focus on loving me and growing myself. That was when Josh asked me out on a date. He had
                                    been my best friend for the last year and I had always had a soft spot for him, so I agreed,
                                    despite my decision to focus on me.
                                </p>

                                    I took Becki for a walk up Painswick beacon, because she had a car and I was broke, and I sat
                                    her down and told her how I felt. Partially because it was eating me up inside, and partially
                                    because we had literally talked about everything else under the sun and I had nothing left to
                                    say.
                                </p>

                                    I, however, had just come out of a relationship and didn't want to start another one so
                                    quickly. I was very shocked and excited at the prospect of dating him, but the timing just wasn't
                                    right. We agreed to hang out more and see where it lead us, without giving it a label.

                                    Unperturbed, I made sure I spoke to Becki every day to see how she was and waited patiently for the
                                    next opportunity. After a month or two, I decided to try my luck and ask her on a real date, this time
                                    with money.

                                    Our first road trip together was to Manchester to see my brother and his family. During our trip, we went
                                    for a beautiful walk along an old train line, I was absolutely exhausted, but I tried my hardest not to
                                    show it so Becki didn't think I was weak. To be fair, I had been giving piggy backs to my two nieces
                                    the entire time.
                                </p>

                                    I loved getting to meet the rest of Josh's family in Manchester, especially his two beautiful nieces,
                                    who will be walking down the aisle with me (alongside a couple more)! We spent most of our Saturday out
                                    on a walk along the canal and old train trecks, during which Josh complained the entire time that his
                                    legs hurt. It was a great first adventure for us, and we soon went on many more to places like Warwick,
                                    Tourquay and London a couple of times!

                                <p style="color:blue">
                                    Keeping the engagement a surprise was inordinately difficult, mostly because Becki knew it was coming for months;
                                    after all, we had designed the ring together, found a venue, and even starting thinking about dates for the big day.
                                    However, somehow, I managed to make a trip to Painswick beacon, where we had our first date, seem blasé.
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:deeppink">
                                    As soon as Josh suggested going for a walk up Painswick beacon, I knew something was up, but I played the fool all the same.                                   . Once we reached the bench we sat on during our first date, I was dying with excitement. But, instead
                                    We walked along the hills until we reached the bench where Josh told me how he felt. He sat at the bench and invited me to
                                    play Dungeons and Dragons with him (one of our favourite hobbies).
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:blue">
                                    There was only way I could orchestrate a proposal perfect enough for Becki's unique personality; to have her
                                    pull it from the bloody corpse of a beaten enemy in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. As is correct, upon heroically
                                    defeating her foe, she set about looting the body, and as I described her finding a small intricate black box,
                                    I pulled the very same box from my pocket and placed it on the table in front of her.
                                </p>
                                <p style="color:deeppink">
                                    When Josh pulled out the small black box from his pocket, I think I actually stopped breathing. Even though we had been planning
                                    getting engaged for so long, I was not at all ready for it to happen! I teared up as Josh got down on one knee,
                                    looked up at me and asked me to be his bride. I, obviously, said yes and hugged him for so
                                    long I might have cut off some of his blood supply, and to this day, it has been the best decision of my life.

                            What we'd really love as our wedding gift is contributions towards our garden. It currently
                            looks like a cross between Jumanji and the Amazon forest, which is not ideal, especially when you
                            can't take two steps out the back door without being whipped in the face with a 6ft weed. We're not
                            looking to have anything too extravagant like the image above, but a bit of patio and a shed would
                            be lovely!

                            Thank you for whatever you decide to give, and we look forward to seeing you on our big day!
